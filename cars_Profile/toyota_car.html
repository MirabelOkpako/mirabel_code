		Dating back to 1966 in international markets, the Toyota Corolla landed on U.S. shores in 1968. With a reputation for quality and dependability, the Corolla has become the best-selling car worldwide — to the tune of nearly 1.5 million per year in more than 150 countries. Now in its 12th generation, the Corolla is primarily known as a four-door sedan, but it’s also been offered in coupe, hatchback and wagon form over the years. Attractive economy-car pricing has always been part of the Corolla’s value proposition, though it has at times been criticized for being too conservative and for making some common features optional to keep the base price low.

		All eyes will linger on you during your commute with Corolla’s refreshed front and rear fascias. The SE and XSE grade’s sport mesh grille stands out for all the right reasons, and available 18-in. alloy wheels * with graphite-colored finish add to its unapologetic profile. Distinct headlights, featuring LED Daytime Running Lights (DRL), add a dazzling final touch to Corolla’s unmistakable design.
