	<h1>Memo Writing</h1>
	
	</center>
	<b>

	<p>Underlying assumption:</p>

	</b>

	<p>
		A memo is usually an internal working paperwritten to shape information and/or instruction amonge peers,most often working for the same organisation or those working together on a common project even though they represent different organisation.Because they're informal working papers,memo are rarely sent to outsiders,especally those you oryour organization want to impress.A business latter is considerered more forceful,and more impressive than a memo
	</p>

	<p>
		Because they're writen to people who are involved in or ;east familia with your work, your organisation and standard pratice of your profession,memos used an informal style in which jargon,abbrevation,and short-term reference to people and organization are acceptable.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most memo requestspecific information,respond to previous question,share new information, or give or give instructions to do something.they may also be written to create "apaper trail"for future reference 
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Note</strong>In recent years in many oraganization,e-mail has incresingly taken the place of hard-copy, memo infact,the basic format of emailis a direct adaptation of memo format.consequently,many of the guideline of writing e-mail and for memo writing are totally interchangeable

	  <h2>working tips</h2>

	  <ul><br>

	  	<li>keep the reader in mind as you write and make the memo as conversational as possible</li><br>

	  	<li>keep it short and focused.its more effective to write series of memo, with one topic per memo, rather than one long.Procter & Gamle e.g consider one page memo the norm</li><br>

	  	<li>prepare the main idea of your memo or make your request before making time on explanation.if background details is necessary,state the key point first and then fill in the background.</li><br>

	  	<li>Explain reference fully enough to aviod confusion.if your organization has many manual or politices,don't vaguely refer to what the "maual saying" or" the policy require" spacify which manual or which specific policy you're refering to</li><br>
	  	
	  	 <li>similarly dont refer to pervious conversation,letters or phone calls without specifying the date topic, gistof that exchange.When youre using e-mail its essay providethis contaxt aviod confussion by passsing keeys part of perious message (s) in your reply.However, it's considere poor "netiquetti" and a waste of brand width to include the entire perious message delete any uncessary or overdetailed information,as well any extraneous comments and formalities.</li>
